# Learning Oriented Object Detection via Naive Geometric Computing

## Introduction
A pytorch implement of the paper Learning Oriented Object Detection via Naive Geometric Computing.
This codebase is created for oriented object detection in remote sensing.

It is modified from [AerialDetection](https://github.com/dingjiansw101/AerialDetection).
The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.1** or higher. If you would like to use PyTorch 0.4.1,
please checkout to the [pytorch-0.4.1](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/pytorch-0.4.1) branch.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](doc/INSTALL.md) for installation.
    
## Get Started

Please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](doc/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the basic usage of mmdetection.
